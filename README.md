To use this application please make sure you have Unity 2021.3.6f1 as your version and make sure to have a Quest (VR Headset) with you.

First thing first lets download the project, so go the Green code button and click on Download ZIP

Now plug in the Quest headset into the pc/laptop

Now lets make sure we can upload the scene to the VR headset to do this first go to file and build settings on Unity

When you are on Build settings switch the platform to Android

After we switch to Android platform you need to build it(this may take time) after it builds save it in a location

Now after saving it X out of the project and reopen it again

Now build and run and the proejct should load up on the VR headset and you can take off the cable and select the spot you want to play the project in

If you want to just play it off of unity you can if you simply just open up the project and hit the run or play button at the top center of the screen

You will be able to walk around and pick objects up that I made interactable. And everything listed in the introudction is now in your hand.
